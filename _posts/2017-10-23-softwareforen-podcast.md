Early this year I was invited by [Softwareforen Leipzig](https://www.softwareforen.de/portal/Veranstaltungen/User-Groups/Softwaretest-und-Qualit%C3%A4tssicherung/Startseite.xhtml) to talk on **Testing in Agile** topic.
It was a 2 days conference where we got to hear topics:

* Agile transformation of big traditional organization
* Roles in Agile environment
* Test case management and automation
* Cost of testing in Scrum teams


My talk was about Quality Assurance in digital banking where I shared a story of building a quality culture in startup environment. 
After the talk we have recored a short podcast with Dr. André Köhler.
