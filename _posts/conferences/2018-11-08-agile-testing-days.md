I have taken a part at one of the biggest European Testing Conferences with my talk  [Onboarding Engineers](https://agiletestingdays.com/2018/session/onboarding-engineers-1/).
I talked about:

- Why is it important to invest in onboarding
- How to create a structured personalized space for new engineers
- What are the values for new joiners and organization.
