I have taken a part at [Test Leadership Congress](https://testleadershipcongress2019.sched.com/event/O5UB/onboarding-test-engineers) in New York, with my talk [Onboarding Test Engineers](https://speakerdeck.com/milan_kuveljic/onboarding-test-engineers-03677616-87ea-4917-a449-a40ddb63e236).
I talked about:

- Why is it important to invest in onboarding
- How to create a structured personalized space for new test engineers
- What are the values for new joiners and organization.
