I was guesting this month at Ministry of Testing - [Testing AMA](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/testing-ask-me-anything).
We had a great conversation about software testing in regulative world. We talked about:

* How modern software development tools and processes are enabling digital bank to be competitive, but without sacrificing security and risk management
* How Agile process and Regulations stay friendly all the way
* Where is Automation helping to be effective but still compliant
