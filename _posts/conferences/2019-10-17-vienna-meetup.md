I was invited to speak at [Test Busters Night](https://meetup.com/Agile-Testautomation/events/264622043/) in Vienna. I presented my talk [Test Architecture for Global Platforms](https://speakerdeck.com/milan_kuveljic/test-architecture-for-global-platforms). 

I talked about:

- Test architectures and challenges
- How to design global platform
- What are the tools and frameoworks that can help
- How to maintain continuous testing
