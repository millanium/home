I was invited as a keynote speaker at [QA Financial Digital Forum](https://www.qa-financial.com/eventsthe-qa-financial-digital-forum-technologies-for-continuous-testing-ai-automation-and-devops). I presented my talk [Crafting Regulatory Compliance in Modern Software Development](). 

I talked about how modern Software Development practices such as CI/CD, automated testing and documentation can craft regulatory compliance as a part of the agile process.
