I have taken a part at [German Testing Day](https://www.germantestingday.info/german-testing-day-2019/programm/konferenzprogramm/sessiondetails/action/detail/session/gtd-23-2/title/onboarding-test-engineers.html) with my talk [Onboarding Test Engineers](https://speakerdeck.com/milan_kuveljic/onboarding-test-engineers).
I talked about:

- Why is it important to invest in onboarding
- How to create a structured personalized space for new test engineers
- What are the values for new joiners and organization.
