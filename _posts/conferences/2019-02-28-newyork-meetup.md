One of the first series of [N26 meetups in New York](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-RaPHYvDN/events/259065290/), actually the very 2nd one, where I talked about [Mobile test architecture](https://speakerdeck.com/milan_kuveljic/mobile-test-architecture) .
My talk was mainly about:

- Automation principles
- How to scope your automation for mobile apps
- How to design the architecture
- How to decide and choose tools
- How to maintain continuous testing for mobile
