What QA doesn’t stand for?
Quality Assurance
Noun: is a way of preventing mistakes or defects in manufactured products and avoiding problems when delivering solutions or services to customers.
QA is not a verb.
It’s not Q&A.
QA is not a person.
QA stands for Quality Assurance.
So when you say “can you please QA this build”, you are asking “can you please Quality Assurance this build?” That’s probably not what you meant.
Probably you mean:
Can you please test this build?
Can you please check these acceptance criteria?
Can you please use your Quality Assurance skills to help ensure this build is of sufficient quality for our customers?

You wouldn’t say:
Can you please IT this computer?
Can you please Development this code?
Can you please Engineering this system?
Can you please Product Management this requirement?
Can you please UX this build?
