My name is **Milan**, and this is my personal web space. 
I am the Head of QA and tester at [N26](https://n26.com), the first European mobile bank.

I started as a Software Test Consultant where I was helping development teams in large organizations in banking and insurance domain to establish automation in testing culture. Later on, I have moved to Berlin to work on quality and reliability improvements in challenging Ad tech space.

In the last decade I have gained practical experience in software testing and quality assurance, in particular, agile testing, automation in testing and tooling around them, which I am sharing with development teams to improve the quality and process of building software.

I strongly believe people are the most important aspect in software development, thus in terms of agile, I have worked with many developers, testers and product managers and helped them to grow both technically and personally.

I am active in the testing community, through our [Slack](https://testersio.slack.com) channel. I share my thoughts @[milan_kuveljic](https://twitter.com/milan_kuveljic), feel free to reach out. I also write about ideas, tools, processes and everything that matters to our [work](/works)

I enjoy speaking publicly at the conferenes and meetups where I share my knowledge and experience.
